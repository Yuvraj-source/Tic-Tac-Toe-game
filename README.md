How to Play

The rules of the game are simple: two players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the spaces on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
